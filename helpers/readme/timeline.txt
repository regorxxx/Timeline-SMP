purposes (instead of a "timeline").

FAQ:
----
- X-Data grouping is only available on 3D charts. This setting
is found at the Display menu 'Chart type\Group X-Data by'.
- When 3D charts are used, the X-groups shown are those with the
higher Y values. The total number can be tweaked as explayed above.
i.e. A chart displaying the Tracks (Y) per Artists (Z) per Date (X)
will only show 3 artists per date by default, and those 3 artists
will be the ones with most tracks (Y) from that date (X).
- Chart types other than 'Timeline' will handle 3D charts in 
different ways drawing multiple series instead.
- To use 2D charts, disable the Z-Axis.
- Panel data may be loaded on demand-only by changing 
'Other settings\Init data on startup' to false. In such cases
the data will be (re)lodaded by double clicking on the settings
buttton or using 'Force data update' at such menu.
- Clicking multiple times into a color palette will randomly apply
a scheme from that same palette.
